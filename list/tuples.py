# TUPLES in python are nothing but lists only but we cannot perform insert and remove operation on typles

# Tuples are immutable list we cannot moddify it like lists.

numbers = (1, 2, 3)
# instead of using [] we use () in tuples

# if we perform insert and remove operation on this tuples we get an error

# numbers.pop()
# numbers.insert()  } this fun will give an errors
# numbers.remove()
